put miracast support back in marshmallow!,b
this be one of the most frustrating google services. crash lag video playback be a hit or miss. need more update,b
keep disconnect often i have to reset almost every time i used as today 71416 officially dead i will switch to a better system to stream,b
pos hard to set up and then win t even cast google s own flag ship browser totally worthless!,b
why can t you have a minus rating so we can give a more accurate review. as useful as a chocolate tea pot. i can t believe you can t fix such a minor problem as connect 2 device together. i can connect to my other phone but not this device that have be specifically design to connect with each other. you would think that with the huge amount of money they make they can pay some school kid to fix this problem.,b
i can t connect at all after the update,b
i cant even cast my screen,b
any time i want to watch netflix on my chrome cast i have to uninstall it and reinstall it each and every time. i will lose connection for some reason while i m watch a movie or show and then i have uninstall and reinstall over and over. i ve have this problem since about a month after i get the chrome cast and i get it in december 122515 .,b
it win t cast on my phone and its not even an iphone,b
didn t find my wifi on galaxy s7 edge. i used the laptop to the setup.,b
work better before update,b
it s not get connected. it show cast screen option and the moment i click it. it get a blank tv screen and the lication say disconnection. need to fix.,b
the very nature of this system mean it should understand virtually any video and audio format you throw at it. alas google have decide to only support a pitiful handful make the whole system next to useless. have some avi wmv divx mkv etc etc file you want to view on your tv? forget it it only support a couple of formats. and even if you do have a file it understand you ll probably get no sound as it only understand a pitiful variety. no dolby digital or dts support etc etc. don t waste your time with this system.,b
work well on sgs5 and sony z. note 10.1 2014 freeze and shut down make it unusable when casting. all other s work ok,b
i have a nice sammy note 4 phone and the latest chrome dongle. i get them to display the big blue logo on the tv but that s about it. it doesn t work. save yourself some hair and an hour off your life you cant get back. don t install this,b
we used to have a computer and wireless keyboard and mouse. they be always run out of battery and be never where we need them. now with chrome cast we have everything at our fingertips! i always have my phone on me! we like this product a lot and have not have any problems.,b
this thing be drive me mad. it work for a couple of month then just stop connecting. i reset it via the unit and reconnect it. nothing. totally bloody hopeless load of crap. i m used a gen two.,b

ok here be the issue of have a htc desire 626 and try to use chromecast device. it win t work with just the htc 626 desire phone you need a separate device or have home wi fi installed. htc have its own device similar to the chromecast but not sure if it s worth the price though and know chromecast can be used by more than one brand device. but two device be require for the htc 626 desire phone. i use my samsung tablet that have no wi fi on its own and have to be a wi fi for it to connect to.,b

i hear the developer of chrome cast have be block by google so that you cannot cast your own picture and movie from your phone. from pressure from netflix be this true?,b
nothing but problem since i first purchase it. constantly unable to maintain any kind of decent stream and the update seem to be completely pointless. whoever say this be ready to go on the market should take themselves off to a round room with no door sit in the corner and have a word with yourselves.,b
doesn t work,b
chromecast win t let my phone connect.,b
work well with home wifi however do not work at all with wifi direct. i prefer to use the mobile network data and not the home network which be far much slower and congested due to multiple device connected. fix this and it s an easy 5 stars!!!,b
overall we have be pretty hy. we own two and have the early connection loss issue but it s better. one issue we do have since the last update be the stop cast featureespecially with the que function in youtube. we just can t get it to stop cast without completely back out of yt open the google cast and shut down from there. not a deal breaker but annoying if you be simply look for something specific or set up a que playlist instead of it auto selecting.,b
when this work it s amazing. but too often it doesn t register the device and take age to get going. fail.,b
a must have device if you use the follow a smart phone; a tv with hdmi port; high speed access to the internet,b

we have have 2 chromecast work beautifully for several years. #google what do you do to ruin my experience? they will not connect without reboot our router. over the past few day we have have to do this more than 5 times. #google what be your solution because i m sit with your equipment and all i want to do be throw it out my window due to frustration. #google be the update intend to ruin my view of your brand? #google what will you do to fix this horrible experience?,b

this be the killer for phones. period. but it need to work without hassle. right now i ve just update and go from work to broken. no good.,b
can t maintain connection to any chromecast audio device for longer than 30 minutes. the latest update actually make thing worse reduce reliable connection time to under ten minutes. and now it often require a complete reboot of wi fi chromecast device and phone in order to get it to work again. note that this problem do not ly to chromecast video devices. chromecast audio badly need a firmware update and this need a rethink.,b
this be only if you have the chromecast device. you need the device to stream your phone tablet or computer run the chrome browser or chrome ium os,b
not sure why this do not allow to forget wi fi network anymore? i can t reconnect my chromecast to my new wifi network,b
i cannot update album to be shown.,b
please solve the privacy issue,b
great to support chromecast,b
this win t download on multiple android devices..,b
too many issue buy a roku. you ruin a great thing.,b
it s not let me do what you guy advertise cast to my screen. video will play on my phone but when i select cast screen it stay black. what s the point of even have your chromecast if it doesn t do what i paid it to do? it s not just my phone. my fiance s do the exact same thing so it s your lication,b
at 1st i be able to cast video from any website but the recent update i can only cast from youtube even if i cast from my phone there be a lag and hang even it 20 mbps speed. google product be very disoint in the product,b
work perfect for age with no sync or connectivity issues. now i can only cast from my phone. this medium be not available when i try to cast from my pcserver,b
i wouldn t be without it!,b
now the chromecast dongle not pick up any signal after update. be the rating fake by google staff? if you think of buy stop until they resolve.the problem.,b
work perfectly with my note 5!,b
i have struggle with this on chromecast2 now for 2mo. i have strong fast wifi yet this constantly disconnects. cc say it have 4bars max signal and be plug into wall socket. all other device laptop tablet smartphone and roku work flawlessly. more frustration than its worth. in my opinion this be a beta!,b
this work wonderfully to cast video movie picture etc. to my devices.,b
completely crash on me. wouldn t let me disconnect even though it wasn t connect in the first place,b
at least on my internet connection! i have the old chromecast and whenever i try to set mine up the process always freeze at connect the chromecast to my internet. i know it s a problem with my internet because when i try the setup at my cousin house it work flawlessly. the chromecast be work fine before i switch isp s to the same one my cousin have so if someone from google can help me out i would be overjoyed. i love my chromecast so much before the incident.,b
still need fast forward function for netflix and other popular s. stream from webpage like vodlocker work well but can get stick on a loop where even after you re do the chromecast restart wake my tv up after i ve close the and stop casting.,b

1. why do i need a chromecast device when you can add an extension or an ?? 2. lose connection in middle of cast and do not reconnect. 3. difficult to understand and to what connect with what. shouldn t i be able to cast my phone to my tablet? or to my chrome browser? so only cast if you have a chromecast device,b

can t watch a movie and decide to watch another it will continuously go back to the previous thing you be cast,b
after the update it fail to find the device. but i guess once you turn off and on the router its back on line .,b
ok but not cool that google does not let you opt out of the location after they scred your wifi password.        should work with youtube but because youtube is not solely an audio it won t work.let the user decide if they need full video or not or ask them.         you should be able to use a chromecast device video to recieve just audio too. i would be nice to sync tvs and speakers across the house.,b
